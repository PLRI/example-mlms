# Arden2ByteCode Example MLMs

If you have already installed [Arden2ByteCode](http://arden2bytecode.sf.net), you can test it by running the MLMs in this directory. Every MLM has instructions at the top, on how to execute it.
In most cases this will be similar to this:

    $ arden2bytecode -r hello_world.mlm

For more information, be sure to have a look at the Arden2ByteCode [Wiki](https://github.com/PLRI/arden2bytecode/wiki), especially the [command-line reference](https://github.com/PLRI/arden2bytecode/wiki/Command-Line-Options).
